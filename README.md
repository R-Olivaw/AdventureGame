# AdventureGame
An adventure game made with OOP in Python 3. Playable in command prompt. Includes a template to make your own map.

Make Your own map.

1. Make a copy of testgame.py and rename it; this will be your map.
2. Use a grid to create a tile-based map. Map tile classes are in world.py
3. In your copy of testgame.py, create your tiles and give them coordinates.
3.1.  north = y increases
3.2.  south = y decreases
3.3.  east = x increases
3.4.  west = x decreases
4. Enter the tile coordinates in the game_map OrderedDict.
5. If you want to create new weapon and armor types, you can that here too. Use the items module. 
6. Import your map in game.py and player.py
